    <h1>Croissants!</h1>

    <h3>What is a croissant? ðŸ¤”</h3>
    <p>
      It's French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.[2] It is a
      buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian
      kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[3]
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. <br />

    <h3>The Origin of Croissants</h3>
    <p>
      Across various accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it
      originates from Austria as the kipferl. Made from a yeasted wheat dough,
      the kipferl is a baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state
      that the kipferl has been around as early as the 13th century, but many
      believe it may be even older. Popular myths attribute its invention as a
      celebration of the Ottoman Empireâ€™s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the
      crescent shape represented the moon on the Ottoman flag.
